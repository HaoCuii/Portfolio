# Portfolio

Created using HTML, CSS for the frontend and styling, and Javascript for th backend. Includes features such as an automatic carousel, self typing text, and smooth paths transitions between different pages, using pure CSS and Javascript. Deployed using Vercel.
This isn't an actualy portfolio, just a cool demo project to show off some of the skills I've learnt.
