# Portfolio

Created using HTML, CSS for the frontend and styling, and Javascript for th backend. Includes features such as an automatic carousel, self typing text, and smooth paths transitions between different pages, using pure CSS and Javascript. Deployed using Vercel.

I made this with the goal of getting better at Javascript and HTML, which I think I've accomplished. It was really hard for me to create the page transitions and on plenty of occassions I thought of giving up, but this project helped me learn perserverence as well. I wouldn't say this is my actual portfolio, since the content is kind of sad, but its definitely a cool thing to show off in the future if I do end up creating a portfolio.
