This isn't an actualy portfolio

I made this with the goal of getting better at Javascript and HTML, which I think I've accomplished. I wouldn't say this is my actual portfolio, since the content is kind of sad, but its definitely a cool thing to show off in the future if I do end up creating a portfolio.
